# Nikeez 

Welcome to Nikeez, a modern web application built with React and Tailwind CSS, designed for sneaker enthusiasts. Explore featured sneakers, discover trending models using Google Gemini AI, and interact with an AI assistant for all your sneaker-related questions.

## Features

*   **Browse Sneakers:** View a curated list of featured sneakers.
*   **Trending Sneakers:** See a list of currently trending sneakers, generated dynamically using the Google Gemini API.
*   **AI Sneaker Assistant:** Ask questions about sneaker news, comparisons, history, and more, powered by Google Gemini.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, adapting to different screen sizes.
*   **Dark Mode:** Sleek dark theme for comfortable viewing.
*   **Routing:** Client-side routing handled by React Router.
*   **(Planned/Optional):** User Login, Wishlist functionality.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
    *   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
    *   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  
*   **Build Tool:**
    *   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (or Create React App, if used)
*   **Package Manager:**
    *   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Project Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd sneakerzz
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Gemini API Key:**

    *   **IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:** The current implementation includes the Gemini API key directly in the frontend code (`src/components/SneakersAssistant.jsx` and `src/pages/Home.jsx`). **This is highly insecure and should NOT be used in production.** Anyone can view your API key by inspecting the browser's source code.
    *   **For Development Only:** Replace the placeholder `GEMINI_API_KEY` constant in the mentioned files with your actual Gemini API key obtained from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or Google Cloud Console.
    *   **For Production:** You **MUST** refactor the code to make API calls from a secure backend server (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Serverless Functions) where your API key can be kept secret. The frontend should then call your backend endpoint instead of the Gemini API directly.

## Running the Project

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    (If using Create React App, the command is likely `npm start` or `yarn start`)

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite/CRA).
